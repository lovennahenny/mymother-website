            <p>My mother was born on February 5, 1983, and raised in a small, peaceful town surrounded by natural beauty and family love. As the second of five siblings and the first daughter, she naturally took on the role of nurturer and became the figure that everyone looked up to. Despite her desire to further her education, she chose to work and support her family during difficult financial times. Her early life was filled with hard work and sacrifice, but she never let these challenges dampen her spirit. Instead, they instilled in her the values of perseverance, resilience, and kindness that she still lives by today.</p>
<br>
            <p>She displays strength, kindness, and creativity. Whether she lends an ear to my siblings and me in times of need or creates beautiful crafts with her hands, she brings light into every space she enters. Her laugh is contagious, and her kindness knows no bounds. She always finds a way to lift those around her, transforming even the simplest gestures into meaningful acts of love. Her wisdom has been a constant guide, and her resilience inspires our family to face life's challenges with courage.</p>
<br>
            <p>She also is a beacon of strength, kindness, and creativity. Whether lending an ear to my siblings and me in times of need or creating beautiful crafts with her hands, she brings light into every room she enters. Her laughter is infectious, and her kindness knows no bounds. She always finds a way to uplift those around her, turning even the smallest gestures into meaningful acts of love. Her wisdom has been a constant guide, and her resilience inspires us to face life’s challenges with courage.</p>
<br>
            <p> Other than that, she has a strong passion for gardening and has transformed our front yard into a vibrant haven of colorful blooms and lush greenery, demonstrating her patience and nurturing spirit. She is also an amazing chef, known for her delicious dishes that have become beloved family traditions, including hearty meals for special occasions and simple comforting recipes made with love. On quieter days, she enjoys sewing, creating beautiful pieces that showcase her creativity and attention to detail. Her sewing projects, whether for a loved one or to add a personal touch to our home, reflect her attention to detail and artistic ability. Each of her passions reflects the love she puts into everything she does.</p>
<br>
           <p>One of my mother's appealing qualities is her simple but thoughtful preferences. She enjoys vegetables and is constantly looking for new ways to include them in her meals. Her favorite drink is Sundrop a refreshing treat she enjoys in her quiet moments. When it comes to flavors, she prefers the timeless simplicity of vanilla. She prefers soft, calming colors that reflect her gentle and serene personality. These favorites reveal her modest and beautiful outlook on life.</p>
<br>
<p>Besides, she also has a few favorite songs and one of them you can hear or just play the video or audio whichever you like.</p>

<h3> Lyrics </h3>
<h3>I Lay My Love On You by Westlife </h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>Just a smile and the rain is gone</p>
<p>Can hardly believe it, yeah</p>
<p>There's an angel standing next to me</p>
<p>Reaching for my heart</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Just a smile and there's no way back</p>
<p>Can hardly believe it, yeah</p>
<p>But there's an angel calling me</p>
<p>Reaching for my heart</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I know that I'll be okay now</p>
<p>This time, it's real</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I lay my love on you</p>
<p>It's all I wanna do</p>
<p>Every time I breathe I feel brand new</p>
<p>You opened up my heart</p>
<p>Show me all your love and walk right through</p>
<p>As I lay my love on you</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I was lost in a lonely place</p>
<p>Could hardly believe it, yeah</p>
<p>Holding on to yesterday</p>
<p>Far, far too long</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Now, I believe it's okay 'cause</p>
<p>This time, it's real</p>
<br>
<p>I lay my love on you</p>
<p>It's all I wanna do</p>
<p>Every time I breathe I feel brand new</p>
<p>You opened up my heart</p>
<p>Show me all your love and walk right through</p>
<p>As I lay my love on you</p>
<br>
<p>I never knew that love could feel so good</p>
<br>
<p>Like a once in a lifetime</p>
<p>You changed my world</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I lay my love on you</p>
<p>You make me feel brand new</p>
<p>Show me your love and walk right through, oh, yeah</p>
<p>As I lay my love on you</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I lay my love on you</p>
<p>It's all I wanna do</p>
<p>Every time I breathe I feel brand new (brand new)</p>
<p>You opened up my heart</p>
<p>Show me all your love and walk right through</p>
<p>Cause I lay my love, I lay my love on you</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I lay my love on you</p>
<p>You make me feel brand new (you opened up my heart)</p>
<p>Show me all your love and walk right through (oh, yeah)</p>
<p>As I lay my love on you</p>
<p>As I lay my love on you</p>
